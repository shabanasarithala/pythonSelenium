    ------ statements

OOPS -
1. class, object, method
class is a collection of objects or it is a template or a blueprint of object or it is a logical entity
object is an entity which has properties and methods or attributes and behaviour. Object is an instance of class
Function and method difference - without class block is called function and with in class called method.
And for the method inside class you will see self keyword.
2 types of methods - static( can call directly using class name) and instance( method will be called using object)
method is group of statements to perform an action
when we declare function within a class it will by default take self keyword which is like object
diff  between parameter or argument - while declaring it is called parameter and while passing it is called as argument
static method - only one instance
variables - global, class, local

method & constructor - constructor will be called at the time of object creation. we don't need to call it specifically
constructor don't have return type. For method, we have to call specifically using object or class name
